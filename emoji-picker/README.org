Provides a way to search for Emojis when using Just Connect (chat).

* Known issues

- Does not work in the sidebar. Only in the Connect app itself.
- Pasting a URL will trigger the suggest box.
- Arrow keys are not supported.
- Sometimes the suggest box is rendered empty.
- Some emojis are not so easily found, for example when they contain a hypen
  (=-=) like: 'See-No-Evil monkey'. It helps searching =:see monk=.

* Installation

1. You will need the Greasmonkey browser plugin:
   - [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/][For Firefox]]
   - For Chrome it MIGHT work with the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo][Tampermonkey plugin]]
2. Click [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fzuellich/just-user-scripts/master/emoji-picker/emoji-picker.user.js][this link]]. An installation dialog should open. Otherwise create a new
   script and paste the content of the link.
3. Make sure the script is enabled.

* How to use

The script only works for the main chat application. The sidebar is not
supported.

1. Activate the search by typing =:= and the first letter of your search.

  For example: =:r= should start showing results for all emojis with the letter
   =r= as first character of a word: =rainbow=, =Umbrella with rain drops=, etc.

2. Press =TAB= to insert the first emoji in the list.

   Due to the fact how the Chat applications handles the submit event of the
   input, we can't use =ENTER=.

3. Clicking on an emoji suggestion will also insert it.


** Tip: Combining words
You can search an emoji that consist of multiple words.

Imagine you want to search for =Umbrella with rain drops=:
1. Typing =:umbrella= will lead to multiple results.
2. Refine your search by adding another word =:umbrella with=. That is still not
   enough.
3. Refine your search even more =:umbrella with rain=.
4. Press =TAB= to insert.

** Tip: Using only the first characters
Because the emoji picker will search from the beginning of each word you can
simplify the aforementioned example.

Imagine you want to search for =Umbrella with rain drops=. Instead of typing out
all the words, you can just use the first characters.

1. Type =:um w r=.
2. Press =TAB= to insert.
